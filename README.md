# NATURE-BASH

These scripts were written to accompany a *Nature* Toolbox article on what researchers can do at the command line. 

To try them out: 

1. Clone this GitHub repository. From the command line, execute `git clone https://github.com/jperkel/nature_bash.git`. 
2. Enter the newly created directory: `cd nature_bash`.
3. Make the scripts executable: `chmod +x *.sh`. 
4. Run `01_init.sh` to start: `./01_init.sh`. 
5. Run the rest of the scripts in order, being sure to prepend each file name with a period (`./02_fix_filenames.sh`, `03_process_data.sh`, etc).
6. Run `99_clean_all.sh` to delete all newly created files.
